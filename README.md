## Jenkins CICD
This Task outlines the process of CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub. I installed Jenkins on a Windows system with WSL Ubuntu, configured a Jenkins pipeline to pull a Jenkinsfile from GitHub, and automated stages for cloning the repository, building a Docker image, and deploying the container. DockerHub was used to pull and customize an Nginx web server image, hosting a website. Git integration in Jenkins automated pipeline triggers, and Ngrok handled external access issues by providing a public URL for webhooks. This setup ensures seamless automation from code changes to deployment.
